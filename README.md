# odin-recipes


My first actual website. 

It's a landing page listing 3 different pages displaying the recipes and their respective images, each with it's own listed ingredients and instructions to cook. Used the anchor element to link different equipment needed for the preparation of a recipe. Used the sub tag to give credits to the original authors of the recipes.

Learned a lot through straight up building the project, googling different html tags if needed, and also using the git workflow commands along the way.
