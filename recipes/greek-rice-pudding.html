    <h2>Ready to try this amazing delicacy? Then, here's how to do it:</h2>
    <hr></hr>  
      <h3>First, these are the ingredients you'll need</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>1.22 kg whole milk</li>
            <li>100 g arborio rice</li>
            <li>50 g sugar</li>
            <li>1/4 large orange (with peel)</li>
            <li>1 tsp vanilla extract</li>
            <li>1 cinnamon stick</li>
            <li>garnish: cinnamon spice</li>
        </ul>

      <h3>Instructions</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>In a large pot, add in the milk, rice, sugar, orange slice, vanilla and cinnamon stick. Bring this mixture to an almost boil and lower heat to a simmer. Allow the mixture to cook on LOW heat, stirring constantly, until it thickens and the rice is cooked â€“ about 30 minutes total time. STAY ON TOP OF THIS POT THE WHOLE TIME. It will bubble over if left unattended. Also, use a skimmer spoon to remove most of the 'skin' that the milk produces from the top of the mixture.</li>
            <li>Transfer portions to four small bowls and sprinkle with cinnamon. Serve warm or allow the pudding to come to room temperature and then cover and refrigerate.</li>
        </ol>
        <h4>Note: this pudding can be served <u>hot</u> or <u>cold</u>.</h4>
