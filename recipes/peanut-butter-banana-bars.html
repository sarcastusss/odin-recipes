    <h2>Ready to try these delicious bars? Then, here's how to do it:</h2>  
      <h3>First, these are the ingredients you'll need</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>2 ripe bananas</li>
            <li>1 cup peanut butter all natural, room temp.</li>
            <li>1/4 cup almond flour (or your preffered flour choice)</li>
            <li>1/3 cup maple syrup (or honey)</li>
            <li>1 egg</li>
            <li>1 tsp cinnamon</li>
            <li>1 tsp baking soda</li>
            <li>pinch of salt</li>
            <li>1/2 cup chocolate chips (plus more for garnish)</li>
        </ul>
      <h3>Instructions</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Preheat your oven to 325° F. Line an 8×8" brownie pan with parchment paper.</li>
            <li>In a large bowl, mash your bananas.  Add in the PB, almond flour, maple syrup, egg, cinnamon, baking soda and salt.  Mix until just combined and then fold in your chips. </li>
            <li>Transfer batter to pan and top with some more chips. Bake for around 25 minutes or until toothpick comes out clean.</li>
            <li>Allow to fully cool prior to slicing. I typically make these at night and allow them to sit overnight in a tupper prior to slicing. </li>
        </ol>
